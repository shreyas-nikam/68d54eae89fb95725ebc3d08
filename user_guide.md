# QuLab: Explainable AI for Sequence Data

## Introduction to Explainable AI (XAI)
Duration: 00:05:00

Welcome to **QuLab**, where we delve into the fascinating world of **Explainable AI (XAI)**, specifically tailored for **sequence data**. In many real-world scenarios, data comes in sequences â€“ think of stock prices over time, sensor readings, or even natural language sentences. While AI models can make powerful predictions on this data, understanding *how* they arrive at those predictions is crucial. This understanding builds trust, ensures fairness, and enables better decision-making, especially in high-stakes fields like finance or healthcare.

This codelab will guide you through key XAI techniques for sequence data, divided into two main categories:

1.  **Pre-modeling Techniques**: These are strategies applied *before* your AI model is trained. Their goal is often to enhance the model's robustness and, by extension, its interpretability. We'll focus on **data augmentation**, which helps create more diverse training data from existing samples, making the model less prone to overfitting and more generalizable.
2.  **In-modeling Techniques**: These are directly built into the model's architecture to provide inherent transparency. Our focus here will be on **attention mechanisms**, which allow a sequence model to dynamically highlight the most important time steps in an input sequence when making a prediction. This reveals the model's "focus" or "reasoning."

The application you're using (QuLab) draws inspiration from the concepts discussed in [1] (as referenced within the application itself), which conceptualizes the impact of techniques on a model through a probabilistic relationship akin to Bayes' theorem. This theorem, often written as:

$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} $$

conceptually illustrates how new evidence (like augmented data, $B$) can update our belief about a hypothesis (like a model's parameters or generalization ability, $A$). Practically, in this lab, we'll observe this impact through changes in model performance.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Why is this important?</b> By the end of this codelab, you'll not only understand how to apply these techniques but also how to interpret their results, giving you a powerful toolkit to demystify the "black box" of sequence-based AI.
</aside>

### Learning Goals

*   Understand the fundamental concepts of sequence-based Explainable AI and how it differs from other XAI methods.
*   Experiment with pre-modeling XAI techniques, specifically data augmentation for time-series data, and observe its impact on model robustness and performance.
*   Apply in-modeling XAI techniques, such as attention mechanisms, to a time-series prediction model to enhance interpretability by identifying influential time steps.
*   Visualize and interpret attention weights to gain insights into model predictions for sequence data.

## Generating Synthetic Time-Series Data
Duration: 00:10:00

To effectively demonstrate XAI techniques without the complexities of real-world datasets, we'll start by generating **synthetic time-series data**. This allows us to control the patterns, noise, and trends, making it easier to see how our XAI methods influence model behavior.

Each synthetic sequence will follow a simple **sinusoidal pattern** with additional random noise and an optional linear trend. For classification, we will generate a binary label: 1 if the final value of the sequence exceeds a certain threshold, and 0 otherwise.

### Step-by-step Usage

1.  **Navigate to "1. Introduction & Data Generation"**: Ensure you are on the first page of the QuLab application using the sidebar navigation.
2.  **Adjust Data Generation Parameters**: In the sidebar on the left, you'll find a section labeled "Synthetic Data Generation Parameters". Experiment with the sliders and input fields:
    *   **Number of Samples**: How many individual time series sequences to generate.
    *   **Number of Timesteps**: The length of each sequence.
    *   **Frequency**: How often the sinusoidal wave repeats.
    *   **Amplitude Noise Scale**: The amount of random variation applied to the amplitude of the wave.
    *   **Pattern Noise Scale**: The general amount of random noise added to the entire sequence.
    *   **Trend Slope**: A linear upward or downward trend added to the sequence.
    *   **Threshold for Label**: The value that determines if a sequence is labeled 0 or 1 based on its final value.
3.  **Generate Data**: Once you're satisfied with your parameter choices, click the **"Generate Synthetic Data"** button in the sidebar. The application will process your request and generate the data.
    <aside class="positive">
    <b>Tip:</b> Start with default values to get a feel for the data, then gradually change parameters to see how the generated series evolve. For instance, increasing `Pattern Noise Scale` will make the waves look more erratic.
    </aside>
4.  **Review Dataset Overview**: After generation, scroll down on the main page to the "Dataset Overview and Initial Visualization" section.
    *   You'll see the **shapes** of the generated features ($X$) and labels ($y$), for example: `Features shape: (1000, 50, 1)`. This means you have 1000 samples, each 50 timesteps long, with 1 feature per timestep.
    *   **Descriptive statistics** provide a quick summary of the values across a few initial time steps.
    *   **Sample Synthetic Time Series Data**: A plot will display a few example sequences, allowing you to visually inspect the patterns, noise, and how the binary labels relate to the end of the series. Notice how some series end above the threshold (Label 1) and others below (Label 0).

## Understanding Data Augmentation for Sequences
Duration: 00:15:00

Now that we have our synthetic data, let's explore **pre-modeling XAI** with **data augmentation**. Data augmentation is a powerful technique to expand the diversity of your training dataset without needing to collect new real-world samples. This process involves applying various transformations to existing data, which can significantly improve a model's robustness and generalization ability. For sequence data, this might include adding noise, scaling, or even more complex time-based distortions.

The idea is that by showing the model slightly varied versions of the same underlying pattern, it learns to recognize the core pattern rather than memorizing specific instances, making it more resilient to real-world variability and thus, more "interpretable" in its broad understanding.

In this application, we focus on two common and effective data augmentation techniques for time series:
1.  **Adding Gaussian Noise**: This involves adding random noise to the time-series values. It simulates minor fluctuations or measurement errors, making the model less sensitive to small variations.
2.  **Amplitude Scaling**: This multiplies the entire sequence by a random factor within a specified range, altering the magnitude of the signal. This helps the model generalize across different scales or intensities of the same pattern.

### Step-by-step Usage

1.  **Navigate to "2. Data Augmentation & Baseline Model"**: Use the sidebar navigation to go to the second page.
2.  **Adjust Augmentation Parameters**: In the sidebar, under "Data Augmentation Parameters", you'll find controls:
    *   **Gaussian Noise Level**: Controls the intensity of the random noise added.
    *   **Min Amplitude Scale Factor**: The minimum factor by which a sequence's amplitude can be scaled.
    *   **Max Amplitude Scale Factor**: The maximum factor.
    *   These parameters define how much variation the augmentation techniques will introduce.
3.  **Visualize Augmented Data**: Scroll down on the main page to the "Visualize Augmented Data" section.
    *   **Select Sample for Augmentation Visualization**: Use the slider in the sidebar to pick a specific sample from your generated data. This sample will be used to demonstrate the effects of augmentation.
    *   Observe the plots:
        *   **Original vs. Noise Augmented Sample**: This line plot shows the original sequence alongside its version with Gaussian noise added. You'll see the overall shape is preserved, but small, random fluctuations are introduced.
        *   **Original vs. Scale Augmented Sample**: This line plot compares the original sequence with its amplitude-scaled version. Notice how the peaks and troughs of the scaled series are either higher/lower than the original, depending on the scaling factor.
        *   **Relationship: Original vs. Noise Augmented Values**: A scatter plot displays every point from the original series against its corresponding noise-augmented value. This plot visually confirms the spread introduced by the noise around the identity line, showing the variability.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Observe the impact:</b> These visualizations are key to understanding what "data augmentation" actually does. You're seeing the creation of synthetic variations that will eventually train a more robust model.
</aside>

## Training a Baseline Model
Duration: 00:10:00

Before we can appreciate the impact of data augmentation and attention mechanisms, we need a point of reference: a **baseline model**. We'll train a simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is well-suited for sequence data due to its ability to capture temporal dependencies. This model will learn to classify our synthetic time-series data without any augmentation.

### Step-by-step Usage

1.  **Ensure you are on "2. Data Augmentation & Baseline Model"**: Remain on the second page.
2.  **Adjust Model Training Parameters**: In the sidebar, locate "Model Training Parameters".
    *   **Epochs**: The number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset. More epochs can lead to better learning but also higher risk of overfitting.
    *   **Batch Size**: The number of samples processed before the model's internal parameters are updated.
3.  **Train Baseline Model**: Click the **"Train Baseline Model"** button in the sidebar.
    <aside class="positive">
    <b>What's happening?</b> The application is taking your raw synthetic data, preprocessing it (scaling values to a standard range, which helps neural networks learn better), and splitting it into training and testing sets. Then, it builds a simple LSTM model and trains it using your specified epochs and batch size.
    </aside>
4.  **Review Baseline Performance**: Once training is complete, the application will display the `Baseline Model Test Accuracy` and `Baseline Model Test Loss`. These metrics indicate how well the model performs on unseen data from your original synthetic dataset. Make a mental note (or write down) these values, as we'll compare them later!

## Training with Data Augmentation
Duration: 00:10:00

With our baseline established, let's train a new model, this time incorporating the **data augmentation** techniques we visualized earlier. By training on a larger, more diverse dataset that includes both original and augmented samples, we aim to improve the model's performance and robustness. The expectation is that this model will generalize better to variations in the data it hasn't explicitly seen before.

### Step-by-step Usage

1.  **Navigate to "3. Attention Mechanisms & Model Comparison"**: Use the sidebar to go to the third page.
2.  **Train Augmented Model**: In the sidebar, click the **"Train Augmented Model"** button.
    <aside class="positive">
    <b>How is this different?</b> The original training data is augmented using both Gaussian noise and amplitude scaling. These new augmented samples are then combined with the original training data. This expanded dataset is then shuffled and used to train a new LSTM model, identical in architecture to the baseline, but now learning from a richer set of examples. The model is still evaluated on the *original*, unaugmented test set to ensure a fair comparison with the baseline.
    </aside>
3.  **Review Augmented Model Performance**: After training finishes, the `Augmented Model Test Accuracy` and `Augmented Model Test Loss` will be displayed. Compare these values to your baseline model's performance. You should observe an improvement in accuracy and/or a reduction in loss, demonstrating the benefits of data augmentation.

## Comparing Model Performance
Duration: 00:05:00

This step provides a direct, visual comparison between the performance of the **baseline model** (trained without augmentation) and the **augmented model** (trained with augmentation). This quantitative comparison highlights the real-world impact of applying a pre-modeling XAI technique like data augmentation.

### Step-by-step Usage

1.  **View Performance Charts**: On the "3. Attention Mechanisms & Model Comparison" page, scroll down to the "Compare Model Performance" section.
    *   You will see two bar charts:
        *   **Model Accuracy Comparison**: This chart visually compares the test accuracy of the Baseline model versus the Augmented model.
        *   **Model Loss Comparison**: This chart compares the test loss of the two models.

    <aside class="positive">
    <b>What to look for:</b> Ideally, the augmented model should show higher accuracy and/or lower loss compared to the baseline. This demonstrates that by making the model learn from more varied examples, it becomes more robust and capable of generalizing better to unseen data. This improved generalization is an indirect form of interpretability, as the model is less reliant on specific data points.
    </aside>

## Demystifying with Attention Mechanisms
Duration: 00:15:00

Now we shift our focus to **in-modeling XAI** with **attention mechanisms**. Unlike data augmentation, which works *before* training, attention mechanisms are integrated *directly into the model's architecture* to provide inherent interpretability. For sequence models, attention allows the model to dynamically "focus" on different parts of the input sequence that are most relevant for a particular prediction.

Think of it like this: if you're reading a long paragraph to answer a question, you don't give equal importance to every word. You pay more attention to the key phrases and sentences. An attention mechanism enables a neural network to do something similar with sequence data.

The core steps for attention mechanisms involve:
1.  **Scoring**: Each element (or "hidden state") $h_t$ in the input sequence is given a "score" based on its relevance to the task, often by comparing it to a query vector $q$.
    $$ s_t = \text{score}(q, h_t) $$
2.  **Softmax Normalization**: These scores are then normalized using a **softmax function** to produce "attention weights" $\alpha_t$. These weights are typically positive and sum up to 1, indicating the relative importance of each time step.
    $$ \alpha_t = \frac{\exp(s_t)}{\sum_{k=1}^T \exp(s_k)} $$
    Here, $\alpha_t$ is the attention weight for the time step $t$, and $T$ is the total number of time steps in the sequence. These are the values we will visualize!
3.  **Context Vector**: A "context vector" $c$ is computed as a weighted sum of the hidden states, using the attention weights. This vector effectively summarizes the most important information from the input sequence.
    $$ c = \sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t h_t $$
    This context vector is then passed to the final prediction layers of the model. By observing these attention weights, we gain insights into *which parts of the sequence the model considered most important* when making its decision.

### Step-by-step Usage

1.  **Remain on "3. Attention Mechanisms & Model Comparison"**: Continue on the third page.
2.  **Train Attention Model**: In the sidebar, click the **"Train Attention Model"** button.
    <aside class="positive">
    <b>Building a smarter model:</b> This action trains a new LSTM model that incorporates our custom `AttentionLayer`. This layer sits between the LSTM output and the final prediction layer, learning to assign attention weights during training. This model is trained on the *original* (unaugmented) training data for clarity, allowing us to focus purely on the attention mechanism's interpretability.
    </aside>
3.  **Review Attention Model Performance**: After training, you'll see the `Attention Model Test Accuracy` and `Attention Model Test Loss`. You can compare these to the baseline and augmented models to see how the attention mechanism impacts overall performance, though its primary goal here is interpretability.

## Visualizing Attention Weights
Duration: 00:05:00

This is where the magic of in-modeling XAI truly shines! By visualizing the attention weights, we can literally see which time steps in a sequence were most influential for the model's prediction. This provides a direct, data-driven explanation of the model's reasoning.

### Step-by-step Usage

1.  **Remain on "3. Attention Mechanisms & Model Comparison"**: Scroll down to the "Attention Mechanism Visualization" section.
2.  **Select Sample for Attention Visualization**: Use the slider to choose a specific sample from the test set. The application will then predict on this sample and extract the attention weights.
3.  **Interpret the Attention Plot**: A plot will appear, showing:
    *   The **original time series** (blue line) for the selected sample, along with its true label.
    *   An overlaid **bar chart representing the Attention Weights** (orange bars). The height of each bar corresponds to the attention weight for that specific time step.

    <aside class="positive">
    <b>What to look for:</b>
    *   **High Attention Weights**: Time steps with taller orange bars are those the model focused on most when making its classification decision.
    *   **Low Attention Weights**: Shorter bars indicate less important time steps.
    *   **Relating to the Label**: For our synthetic data, remember the label (0 or 1) is determined by the final value of the sequence. Observe if the attention mechanism focuses on the later time steps, especially around the end, which would intuitively make sense for this labeling scheme. Do you see a strong focus on the trend or the final part of the sinusoid?
    </aside>
    This visualization provides a transparent window into the model's decision-making process, making it significantly more interpretable.
